Before getting started, it is best to create a virtual environment so that the packages are not polluting any other projects. 
First navigate to the directory you would like to create the virtual environment folder and run the following commmand:

`
    python -m venv <name of virtual environment folder>
`    
Once python is install, all the libraries used by the automation can be installed by running the commands below:

	C:\> pip install -r requirements.txt

`

Tests can be run through command prompt using:

`python -m robot -A run_config ./test_submissions`
